Step 1 – Select Project Topic: Changes in worldwide air quality

Step 2 - Identifying Data sources

1.	organised_world_data.csv data from “World Data 2023 dataset”, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/countries-of-the-world-2023, Author: NIDULA ELGIRIYEWITHANA, accessed 11/7/2023
2.	air pollution deaths: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshat0giri/death-due-to-air-pollution-19902017, , author: AKSHAT_GIRI, accessed 15/7/2023
3.	Annual-co2-emissions-per-country: https://ourworldindata.org/co2-dataset-sources
4.	Air pollution data by year: from Open Weather API (Lat/Lon: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather? & Air Pollutants: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/air_pollution?) for air pollutants & Lat/Lon. The requests were made based on the merged data list of countries and capital cities. 
5.	Co2 Emission by year csvdata from: CO2 Emission by countries Year wise (1750-2022), https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moazzimalibhatti/co2-emission-by-countries-year-wise-17502022, authors: MOAZZIM ALI BHATTI, EMMANUEL MADANGA, accessed 13/7/23
6.	GDP by year csv file data from: PIB-GDP Global by countries since 1960 to 2021,  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fredericksalazar/pib-gdp-global-by-countries-since-1960-to-2021,  author: FREDERICK ADOLFO SALAZAR SANCHEZ, accessed 15/7/2023


Step 2 - merging, cleaning and processing data using excel, jupyter notebook and python
-	Reading csv into pandas
-	Reordering columns 
-	Removing irrelevant columns
-	Renamed columns
-	Checked row counts and type for each columns
-	Changed data types where required to be suitable for data comparison
-	Dropped rows with incomplete data
-	Set index as country
-	Wrote to csv 

Files used for cleaning processes:
-	world_data_2023_cleanup.ipynb
-	include list RG to do
- 	Merge_Data_sources(use full name)


Step 3: Research Questions and Visualisations

Project Introduction (Rhiannyn)
Air pollutants and the AQI: Top 5 countries by air pollutants other than Co2 – the “top 5 worst pollutants” list (Rhiannyn) & Deaths by Air pollution
Bar graph of top 5 countries, graph of the air pollutants

Understanding the link between C02 emissions and the causing impact on death? (Raviska)

Which countries have the highest and lowest C02  emissions from 2000 to 2021? (Raviska)
How are countries world wide rated according to AQI (Air Quality Index)?

Can we measure countries’ economic prosperity according to environmental impact? 
Variables being measured: GDP against CO2 emissions: is there a correlation? (Sagar)
Scatterplot & Line graph

Average CO₂ Emission in Billion tonnes per Year and how is has been varying over years (Priya)
